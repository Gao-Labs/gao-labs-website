At the heart of my research is the development of a digital twinâ€”a sophisticated simulation tool that brings together various aspects like land use, transportation, emissions, air quality, and justice. This tool helps us better understand and tackle complex challenges in urban development and environmental sustainability.
 
I use data-driven methods to build automated simulation models, employing advanced techniques like machine learning to understand how transportation systems affect climate change, air quality and justice. By analyzing big datasets, I aim to uncover practical insights that can guide policy-making and promote fairness within communities.
 
I have worked on environmental policy at Consumer Reports and California Air Resources Board, focusing on the Low Carbon Fuel Standard.
